### Description
We created four buttons that represent keys with different tones. When the sensor is covered the tone that is heard from the keys is lower, when the sensor is exposed to the surroundings the tone of the keys is higher. 

### Process, Difficulties, and Things We Learnt:
- We started off by building the circuit. Initially we thought our circuit was built just right, but we tried running it we realized that few of the connections related to the resistors were made wrong. We fixed them and then we ran our code.
- The code was not running like we expected. When we tried debugging we realized that the issue was that we did not define the pin modes. 
- After fixing that issue we were able to have it work as needed. 
- We felt like the sound of the buzzer was too low, and that it did not really show the difference we were trying to make. So, we decided to switch it with a bigger buzzer. When we did so, we were able to clearly detect the difference when the sensor is covered and when it is not.
