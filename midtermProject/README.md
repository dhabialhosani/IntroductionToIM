#### Difficulties and Things I Learnt in the Process:

- I learnt a lot in terms of what effective tools are available to use in p5js and when it is most useful to use them. I ususally stir away from using classes just because they seem a bit complicated to me, but in this project specifically they made the process so much easier.
- Another thing I learnt is how difficult debugging can be and why it is extremely important to have my code commented not just for those who will read but also for myself when I try to go back and fix certain issues. 
- Also given that my code was relatively long this time, I explored different ways throuh which I could shorten it mainly the usage of functions and loops. 
- One interseting thing that I did not know about in p5js was that you could add videos just like you add images. You load them using the createVideo function.
- To avoid repetition I will not get into the details of my code, however one major difficulty I faced was when I started off with a different idea that involved randomizing the numbers that appeared on the blocks while ensuring that the numbers do not get repeated. 
- Through creating this project I feel like I have a better picture on how my earlier idea could have been properly coded which is something I look forward to explore. 
- Another difficulty I would was navigating the concept of time in the code and knowing how and when each card should flip. 
- Finally I also would say the transitions in my menu were not smooth at all at first and I had to do some thinkin to figure out where the errors lie. 
- Moving forward I think I would take by my friend's advice and attempt to add a timer. Also I would like to work on things refining the overall look of the game to have it be more aesthetically pleasing.
