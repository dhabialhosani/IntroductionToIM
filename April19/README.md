### In Class Exercises
Shaikha and I worked together on these exrcises as I needed some assistance on how to work my way through them given that I was not in class when those exercises were being solved. 

### Exercise 1:
For this exercise we had to find a way to use the light sensor and potentiometer to control the x position and y position of the circle. After a few trials, Shaikha and I were able to figure that out. The code attached in the folder shows our work for this exercise. 

### Exercise 2: 
We faced a few struggles with the this exercise. We were trying to use a simple circuit with  buttons 1 and 0 to determine the brightness of an led. Despite several trials the serial communicationg between the arduino and the P5JS did not work. I have a version of our code in the folder for reference.
