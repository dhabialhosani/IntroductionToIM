### Inspiration Behind our Project?

Our project was inspired by one of the assignments we worked on while exploring the different applications that could be done with Arduino. Initially, we thought of the vault idea only. We were planning on having a program wherein the user is meant to unlock the vault on P5Js using a potentiometer. To allow ourselves a chance to explore more and create a more interesting project, we decided to turn it into a game. 

### How Does it Work?

The game is intended to be played by two players. The first player is meant to enter a passcode to the vault. They do so by entering a value in the designated bar on the P5JS screen. After that the second player is meant to figure out what the passcode to the vault is through spinning the potentiometer. In this instant the first player is able to sabotage the process for the second player through pressing on the button that produces a loud beeping sound and turns on a flash. Once the second player is able to crack the code, they are meant to press the button and finally the vault unlocks. 

### What Does it Look Like?
