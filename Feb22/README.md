#### Process, Difficulties, and Things I Learnt:
At first I was looking for inspiration to decide what to create for this assignment, I came accross several pieces and videos that all seemed to equip the idea of displaying countries' weathers. I found that very interesting and so I attempted to create a similar project using the same concept of displaying data about different countries but what I chose to do was to display their capital cities rather than their weathers. 
The link below is of one of the videos that inspired me, here Daniel Shiffman visualized the weathers of different countries into a final image. While that was interesting, iven that my idea doesnt involve numerical data, I thought displaying it as it is would also be interesting.

I started by creating my own csv file because those I accessed online had far more data than I required. Given that their are quite a lot of countries in the world I wasn't able to include all of them with their capital cities, so I decided to randomly choose 45 countries. This could be a later improvement to the project, perhaps trying to create a more inclusive data set or trying to find one online would make my project more effective in terms of what it produces.
