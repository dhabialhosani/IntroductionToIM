## Below is the self portrait I created on p5.js

#### Difficulties and Things I Learnt in the Process:
In creating this project I faced a few difficulties in terms of:
1. Drawing the arcs.
2. Having two identical drawings being reflected on each side of the face. 
3. Working with the correct coordinates and positions. 
4. Adding detail to the sketch.



I also learnt quite a lot as I was inspired by already done self portraits on j5ps:
1. I learnt how to use the beginShape command.
2. I learnt how to navigate the coordinates of the shapes.
3. I learnt the importance of changing the fill and stroke as I worked. 
4. While I did not use comments in this project, I realized how helpful they could be in terms of organizing the work.
