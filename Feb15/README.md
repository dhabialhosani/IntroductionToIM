#### Difficulties and Things I Learnt in the Process:

1.I faced difficulties in terms of having the butterflies move in vertical motion. I was able to resolve that by constantly updating the y position under the move method of the butterfly class. 
2.I was not sure as to how to use the arrays, but once I got the hang of them they simplified my code very much. I got help from the following video to navigate the use of arrays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQoUghHSxU
3.Given that the use of constructors was new to me, sometimes I forgot to use “this.” to specify which led to lags in my code. 
4.I also learnt the importance of differentiating between local and global variables as I tried to call the Butterflies array in the setup function and then was unable to use it anywhere.
